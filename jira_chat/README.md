# Jira Chat Integration

This package provides integration with popular chat platforms for interacting with Jira data.

## Planned Integrations

- Slack integration for Jira operations
- Microsoft Teams integration
- Discord bot for server-based Jira management

## Implementation Plan

The chat integrations will be implemented as bot services that can:

1. **Listen for Commands**: Respond to specific commands in chat
2. **Provide Issue Information**: Fetch and display issue details
3. **Perform Actions**: Create, update, and comment on issues
4. **Send Notifications**: Alert users about issue updates and assignments

## Getting Started (Future)

```python
# This is how the API will work when implemented
from jira_chat import slack

# Start the Slack bot
slack.start_bot(token="your-slack-token")
```

## Dependencies (Planned)

- slack-bolt (for Slack)
- botframework-connector (for Microsoft Teams)
- discord.py (for Discord)
- jira-interface core package
