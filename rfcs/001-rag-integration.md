# RFC 001: RAG Integration for Jira API Interface

- **Feature Name**: RAG Integration
- **Start Date**: 2023-03-06
- **RFC PR**: (to be created)
- **Implementation PR**: (to be created)

## Summary

This RFC proposes integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities into the Jira API Interface to provide intelligent analysis of Jira issues, suggest solutions based on similar past issues, and build an organizational knowledge base.

## Motivation

Jira users often face similar issues repeatedly, but the knowledge gained from resolving these issues is not systematically captured or reused. By integrating RAG capabilities, we can:

1. Automatically identify similar past issues
2. Suggest solutions based on how similar issues were resolved
3. Build an organizational knowledge base of issue resolutions
4. Save time and effort in issue resolution

## Detailed Design

### Components

1. **Issue Vectorization**
   - Convert issue descriptions, comments, and metadata into vector embeddings
   - Use a pre-trained embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002)
   - Store embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, or Chroma)

2. **Similarity Search**
   - Implement semantic search to find similar past issues
   - Use cosine similarity or other distance metrics
   - Return top N most similar issues

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Integrate with OpenAI API or other LLM providers
   - Implement prompt engineering for issue analysis
   - Generate solution suggestions based on similar issues

4. **Knowledge Base**
   - Store successful resolutions
   - Implement feedback mechanism to improve suggestions
   - Build a searchable knowledge base

### API Design

```python
# Core RAG functions
def vectorize_issue(issue: Dict[str, Any]) -> np.ndarray:
    """Convert an issue to a vector embedding."""
    
def find_similar_issues(issue: Dict[str, Any], top_n: int = 5) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Find similar past issues using semantic search."""
    
def analyze_issue(issue: Dict[str, Any], similar_issues: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze an issue using LLM and suggest solutions."""
    
def save_resolution(issue: Dict[str, Any], resolution: str, feedback: str) -> None:
    """Save a successful resolution to the knowledge base."""
```

### Command-line Interface

```
# New CLI commands
jira-interface --action analyze-issue --issue-key PROJ-123
jira-interface --action find-similar --issue-key PROJ-123 --top 5
jira-interface --action suggest-solution --issue-key PROJ-123
jira-interface --action save-resolution --issue-key PROJ-123 --resolution "Fixed by..."
```

### Configuration

```yaml
# New configuration options in config.env
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_API_KEY=your-api-key
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
COMPLETION_MODEL=gpt-4
VECTOR_DB_PATH=~/.config/jira-interface/vector_db
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Basic Integration (2 weeks)**
   - Set up embedding generation
   - Implement vector storage
   - Basic similarity search

2. **Phase 2: LLM Integration (2 weeks)**
   - Connect to LLM API
   - Implement prompt engineering
   - Basic solution suggestion

3. **Phase 3: Knowledge Base (2 weeks)**
   - Implement knowledge storage
   - Add feedback mechanism
   - Create knowledge base search

4. **Phase 4: CLI and Documentation (1 week)**
   - Add CLI commands
   - Write documentation
   - Create examples

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Rule-based matching**: Less flexible and requires manual rule creation
2. **Keyword search**: Less semantic understanding, misses conceptually similar issues
3. **Third-party integration**: Dependency on external services, potential data privacy issues

## Open Questions

1. How to handle sensitive information in issue descriptions?
2. How to evaluate the quality of suggested solutions?
3. What is the optimal vector database for our use case?
4. How to handle the cost of LLM API calls?

## Resources Required

1. LLM API access (e.g., OpenAI API key)
2. Vector database storage
3. Additional Python dependencies:
   - `openai`
   - `numpy`
   - `faiss` or `pinecone-client` or `chromadb`
   - `tiktoken`
